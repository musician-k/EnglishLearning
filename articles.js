Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. just three stories."

                "english": "It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl."

                "english": "So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him？\" They said: \"Of course.\" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college."

                "english": "And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents'savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out."

                "chinese": "而我在这里上学，几乎花光了父母这一辈子的积蓄。所以我决定退学，相信车到山前必有路。我那时很害怕，但现在看来，那是我人生中做得最正确的决定。我退学的那一刻，就再也不用上毫无兴趣的必修课，然后我开始旁听那些我喜欢的课。",
                "english": "And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting."

                "english": "It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:"

                "chinese": "那时的里德大学拥有也许是全美最好的书法课。校园里的海一幅海报，每一个抽屉的标签都是漂亮的美术字。因为我退学了不必去上必修课，所以我决定去学一门书法课，学习怎么写出这样的字体。",
                "english": "Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this."

            {
                "chinese": "我学到衬线和无衬线字体，英文字母组合的间距规则，学到了是什么让这些印刷体变得如此美丽。那种美感，给人的历史感和艺术享受，是科学无法捕捉到的。我被完全吸引了。",
                "english": "I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating."

                "chinese": "当时看起来这些东西好像对我的人生来说没有任何实用价值。但是十年之后，当我们在设计第一台 Macintosh 电脑的时候，它一下子浮现了出来。我们将这些东西全部设计进了 Mac ，于是漂亮的印刷体第一次出现在电脑上。如果我当年没有旁听这一门课，苹果就不会有如此丰富的字体以及漂亮的字间距。",
                "english": "None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts."

                "chinese": "鉴于微软只知道抄袭苹果，估计没有个人电脑会有这些。如果我没有退学，没有旁听这门书法课，也许个人电脑就不会有如此美丽的印刷体。当然在大学的时候我不可能预见到它们之间的联系，但在10年之后回首往事 一切都非常非常明了。",
                "english": "And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later."
            },
            {
                "chinese": "同样的，你们也无法预知未来，只有回头看时才会发现它们的关系，所以你必须相信你现在获得的点滴会在未来连结起来。你必须相信一些东西：直觉、命运、人生、因果，什么都没关系，因为如果你相信这些点滴会连接起你未来的道路，你就会拥有跟随自己内心的自信，即使你的选择不被主流认同，这将使一切都变得不一样。",
                "english": "Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing in the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when they leave you off the well-worn path. And it has made all the difference."

                "english": "I was lucky. I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a billion company with over 4000 employees. We just released our finest creation - the Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30 and then I got fired."

                "english": "How can you get fired from a company you started？ Well, as apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating."

                "english": "I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me – I still loved what I did. The turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over."

                "english": "I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life."

Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle."

                "english": "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.

Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
